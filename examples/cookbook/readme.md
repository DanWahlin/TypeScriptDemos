##Steps to run the application:

####Compiling TypeScript with npm:

1. Run "npm install" at the command-line from the root of the project (where the package.json file lives). 
2. Run "npm start" at the command-line. This will compile all of the TypeScript files and generate .js and .map (for debugging) files. 
A watcher will also be created to monitor any changes in the .ts files. Leave the command-window open while doing development work.
3. Open the project folder in VS Code (http://code.visualstudio.com) or another editor.

####Compiling TypeScript with Gulp:

If you'd prefer to compile with Gulp do the following:

1. Run "npm install" at the command-line from the root of the project (where the package.json file lives). 
2. Run "gulp" at the command-line. This will compile all of the TypeScript files and generate .js and .map (for debugging) files.
3. Open the project folder in VS Code (http://code.visualstudio.com) or another editor.
